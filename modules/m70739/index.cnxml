    <para id="import-auto-id1350820">Drawings using lines to represent <term id="import-auto-id1116912">electric fields</term> around charged objects are very useful in visualizing field strength and direction.

    <caption>The electric field surrounding three different point charges. (a) A positive charge. (b) A negative charge of equal magnitude. (c) A larger negative charge.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1977836">In many situations, there are multiple charges. The total electric field created by multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual fields created by each charge.</para><para id="import-auto-id2681099"><link target-id="import-auto-id3285646"/> shows how the electric field from two point charges can be drawn by finding the total field at representative points and drawing electric field lines consistent with those points. While the electric fields from multiple charges are more complex than those of single charges, some simple features are easily noticed.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id3437592">For example, the field is weaker between like charges, as shown by the lines being farther apart in that region. (This is because the fields from each charge exert opposing forces on any charge placed between them.) (See <link target-id="import-auto-id3285646"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id2648567"/>(a).) Furthermore, at a great distance from two like charges, the field becomes identical to the field from a single, larger charge.</para><para id="import-auto-id2402415"><link target-id="import-auto-id2648567"/>(b) shows the electric field of two unlike charges. The field is stronger between the charges. In that region, the fields from each charge are in the same direction, and so their strengths add. The field of two unlike charges is weak at large distances, because the fields of the individual charges are in opposite directions and so their strengths subtract. At very large distances, the field of two unlike charges looks like that of a smaller single charge.</para><figure id="import-auto-id3285646"><media id="import-auto-id3163763" alt="Two charges q one and q two are placed at a distance and their field lines shown by curved arrows move away from each other.
